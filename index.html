        <p class="chapter_title">Tempo, key, and time signature</p>
        <p class="chapter_content">
          Each project has a set of properties, including tempo, key signature,
          and time signature. For new projects, the default project tempo is 120
          beats per minute (bpm), the key is C, and the time signature is 4/4.
          You can change these project properties when you create a project, or
          later while you’re working. The project tempo, key, and time signature
          are displayed in the LCD in the center of the control bar, along with
          the current playhead position.

        <p class="chapter_content">Tempo</p>
        <p class="chapter_content">
          The project tempo defines the musical speed of the project, expressed
          as the number of beats per minute (bpm). Changing the tempo can affect
          the playback speed of audio and software instrument recordings,
          Drummer regions, and Apple Loops, in the project.
        </p>
        <p class="chapter_content">Key</p>
        <p class="chapter_content">
          The project key defines the central note (called the tonic), and
          whether the project uses the major or minor scale. Changing the key
          affects the playback of Apple Loops in the project, and the display of
          MIDI notes in the Score Editor.
        </p>
        <p class="chapter_content">Time signature</p>
        <p class="chapter_content">
          The project time signature defines how musical time is divided into
          measures and beats. The time signature contains two numbers separated
          by a slash (/), which looks similar to a fraction. The first number
          controls the number of beats in each bar, and the second number
          controls the beat value (the note that counts as one beat). Changing
          the time signature does not affect playback, but does affect the units
          displayed in the ruler and the bars in the Score Editor.

          (such as an electric guitar) connected to your computer, on an audio
          track in the Tracks area. The recording appears as an audio region on
          the selected audio track, showing an audio waveform. You can arrange
          and edit audio regions in the Tracks area, and edit them in a close-up
          view in the Audio Track Editor.

        <p class="chapter_content">
          When you add a track, you can choose a patch for the track in the
          Library. You can quickly audition patches to find the one you want to
          use, and change the effects for an audio track by choosing a different
          patch. Each audio patch contains one or more audio effects, and can
          include sends and other routing settings.

          The Tracks area is where you arrange the recordings, Apple Loops, and
          other musical material in your project, organizing them into sections
          such as intro, verse, and chorus to build an arrangement. The Tracks
          area shows a visual representation of time moving from left to right.
          You build a project by arranging regions in rows called tracks, that
          run horizontally across the Tracks area.
        </p>
        <p class="chapter_content">
          Regions are the building blocks of a project, representing your
          recordings, Apple Loops, and other media files you add to the project.
          Regions appear as rounded rectangles in the Tracks area. There are
          several different types of regions, depending on the track type. The
          two primary region types are audio regions, which show the audio
          waveform, and MIDI regions, which show note events as thin rectangles.

          The Piano Roll Editor shows the notes in MIDI regions on a software
          instrument track as colored bars in a time grid. On the grid, a note’s
          horizontal position indicates where the note starts playing, while its
          vertical position indicates its pitch. A keyboard graphic along the
          left edge of the Piano Roll Editor provides an easy guide to the
          pitches of notes.

        <p class="chapter_content">
          In the Audio Track Editor, you can move and trim, split, and join
          audio regions, play a region in isolation, and edit regions in other
          ways. Edits you make in the Audio Track Editor are nondestructive, so
          you can always return to your original recordings.

        <p class="chapter_content">
          You can also quantize and edit the pitch of audio material in the
          Audio Track Editor using Flex Pitch. When you choose a Flex Pitch
          algorithm, the contents of the audio track are analyzed for pitch, and
          the results are displayed as a pitch curve overlaid on the waveform.

          can adjust to control the sound of the patch. Smart Controls typically
          include EQ or tone controls, reverb and other effects controls, and
          controls specific to the type of track or instrument. For example, the
          Smart Control for a synthesizer might include screen controls for
          choosing the waveform and adjusting the resonance and filter cutoff,
          while one for a string instrument might include controls for changing

          a channel strip that corresponds to its track type. You can control
          the sound of the track using its channel strip controls, which include
          Mute and Solo buttons, a Volume fader and level meter, a Pan/Balance
          knob, and others. You can also add effects plug-ins, change plug-in

          Apple Loops are prerecorded musical patterns that you can use to
          quickly add drum beats, rhythm parts, and other musical phrases to a
          project. Apple Loops contain musical patterns that can be repeated
          over and over, seamlessly. After you add a loop to the Tracks area,
          you can extend it to fill any amount of time. When you add an Apple
          Loop to a project, it automatically matches the project tempo and key.
          Apple Loops are available in a variety of instruments, genres, and
          moods in the Loop Browser.

          choose a drummer preset, edit drum settings to adjust the playing
          style, exchange drum kits, and choose individual drum sounds. To work
          with Drummer, you add a Drummer track to the project. A Drummer track
          is similar to a software instrument track, but it contains only
          Drummer regions, rather than MIDI regions. Both track and region
          parameters can be edited using the dedicated Drummer Editor.

          Track Stacks provide a convenient way to organize and control multiple
          tracks, to manage projects with high track counts, and to create audio
          subgroups. There are two types of Track Stacks:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Folder stacks let you combine multiple tracks and control them as a
            unit, without changing their individual routing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Summing stacks let you combine multiple tracks and route their
            output to an audio subgroup.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p class="chapter_content">
          Both types have a main track and one or more subtracks. The track
          header for the main track features a disclosure triangle that lets you
          show or hide the subtracks. When you close the stack, only the main
          track appears in the Tracks area. In the demo project, the Backing
          Vocals, Synthesizers, and Song FX tracks are folder stacks, and the
          Outro Vocal Stack is a summing stack.
